*Plans*
- Get routing working. This means the route guard and the paths to add the gameid or session id. The path should be: /game/[gameid]/map/[mapid] or /game/[gameid]/session/[sessionid]/map/[mapid]
- /session/[sessionid]/home is the current screen that the GM is controlling. It is where you go for the 'join session' 
- Get some basic dB saves working
-- New Game
-- Map
- Get attachments working for Game and Map
- Game and Map Cards
